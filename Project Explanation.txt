## 🌟 Project Explanation Using STAR Method

### 📌 Problem Statement (S - Situation)

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, businesses generate vast amounts of data across various channels, including website activity, product sales, customer behavior, and marketing platforms. However, most businesses struggle to convert this raw data into actionable insights that help in tracking performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.

The lack of a centralized analytics solution often leads to:
- Difficulty in tracking revenue trends and customer behavior.
- Poor visibility into high-performing products, categories, and channels.
- Limited understanding of customer retention and acquisition metrics.
- Inefficient decision-making due to unstructured and uncleaned data.

### 🎯 Objective (T - Task)

The objective of this project was to build a robust **E-Commerce KPI Analytics Dashboard** that enables:
- Tracking of key business metrics (revenue, orders, margin, etc.)
- Understanding customer retention, repeat purchase behavior, and acquisition trends.
- Analyzing sales performance by product category, channel, and time.
- Identifying top-performing products, channels, and customer cohorts.

### 🔧 Approach (A - Action)

I followed a **systematic data engineering and BI process**, structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection & Database Design (SQL)**:
   - Created a star schema with fact and dimension tables: `orders`, `order_items`, `customers`, `products`, and `web_events`.
   - Implemented SQL views for monthly trends, RFM analysis, customer cohorts, and funnel analysis.
   - Used complex SQL queries to derive KPIs and retention metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning (Python - Pandas)**:
   - Rounded off financial figures (unit price, cost, discount, tax) for better readability.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed datasets using Python and saved them in CSV format.

3. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**:
   - Built interactive visuals for:
     - Revenue growth over time.
     - Product performance and category breakdown.
     - Customer funnel (views → cart → sessions → purchases).
     - RFM segmentation & cohort retention.
     - Channel-wise revenue and repeat customer trends.
   - Integrated filters for category, channel, and date range.

4. **Tools Used**:
   - SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
   - Python (Pandas in VS Code / Colab)
   - Power BI
